Thai Cafe README
****************

Once upon a time, a student named Katie stumbled upon a "Hidden Gem" of Jackson known as Thai Cafe. Many years later, when Queen Deloach asked for a website, the idea POPPED into Katie's mind. Katie would honor the delicious curry she had once eaten by creating a website.

We chose to create a website for Thai Cafe to promote it as a small business because not many people know about it, and it deserves more credit for its tasty food. Despite neither of us being pro-coders, we managed to create an excellent website by working together as a team. As we worked together, we each used our own strengths to make sure the website does this amazing business justice. For example, Alla had a better eye for the aesthetics of the website while Katie had a stronger grasp on the actual coding of the website.


Entire Website:

-After talking to the owner, we wanted to make sure that we conveyed the passion she held for her restaurant throughout the website.

-The Thai/Asian theme is placed throughout the website through the font for the header, the color scheme, the favicon, and the dragons on the menu page. 

-Thai Cafe didn't have a definitive logo or slogan so we had to get creative. The picture next to the name comes from one of the many decorations in the restaurant that we felt complimented the website well. We thought of the slogan after the owner talked about how she wanted to bring the unique taste of her country right here to the people of Jackson.

-We didn't over crowd the website because we didn't want to distract people from what's important- the restaurant itself.

-The feeling the website gives off reflects the feeling of the restaurant, cozy and comfortable.

-We made the website as responsive as possible to make sure it's working and viewable on all screen sizes.

-Our code is organized to make sure that it's easy to make changes if needed.


Home Page:

-We chose the three-column layout to make sure the information is easy to view by anyone.

-We put the slideshow in the middle of the page to make sure it's what the eye is drawn to when first visiting the website.

-The text on the home page reflects both the homey feel of the restaurant and the owner's priorities.


Menu Page:

-We chose to do an accordion menu so that we could display the entire menu without overcrowding the website.

-We added the dragons both to decorate the page and to reinforce the theme of Thai Cafe. Even though they gave us a hard time when we were positioning them; it was worth it in the end.


Location & Hours Page:

-The reason for the picture on the right of the page to make sure people know what to look for because it's a small building and it's easy to miss.

-We added the map so it would be easy for people to see where it is in relation to other restaurants and roads.


About & Contact:

-The picture on the right is the picture we took of the owner, who is also the chef.

-The paragraph on the left was taken from the menu and was chosen because it shows her dedication to providing an exceptional experience for her customers.


Reviews:

-We chose to add the reviews because we wanted people to read about others first-hand experience at Thai Cafe.

-We chose to have two columns so the reviews wouldn't over crowd the page; however, that made it difficult to read them so we added the animation.

-We added the links to external sites so people would have a chance to look at more reviews.

-We added the "spin" effect to the icons so that it would be obvious that they're clickable.


After many months under the watchful eye of Queen Deloach, Princess Katie and Princess Alla were able to complete their beautiful website. 
 

Thank You for taking the time to look at our website!
